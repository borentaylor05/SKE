<h1>Application and Eligibility</h1>
<h2>What is the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program (LRP)?</h2>
<p>The United States continues to experience a professional nursing shortage that is expected to increase given the aging demographic of the U.S. population and a growing need for health care. Further compounding this problem, U.S. schools of nursing cannot adequately expand enrollment levels due to a shortage of nurse faculty. NURSE Corps LRP assists in addressing these issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NURSE Corps LRP, formerly known as the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP), is administered by the Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The purpose of NURSE Corps LRP is to assist in the recruitment and retention of professional registered nurses (RNs), including advanced practice RNs (i.e., nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives, clinical nurse specialists), dedicated to working in health care facilities with a critical shortage of nurses, referred to as a Critical Shortage Facility (CSF), or working as nurse faculty at an eligible school of nursing, by decreasing the financial barriers associated with pursuing a nursing profession. The program offers these RNs substantial financial assistance to repay a portion of their qualifying educational loans in exchange for full-time service at either a health care facility with a critical shortage of nurses or at an eligible school of nursing in the case of  nurse faculty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Up to twenty percent of NURSE Corps LRP funds will be made available for nurse faculty, and up to fifty percent of NURSE Corps LRP funds will be made available for nurse practitioners (NPs). The purpose of these set-asides is to address the key issues as identified above pertaining to the expanding need for health care and the nursing pipeline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Guidance describes two different contract service options:</p>
<p></p>
<p>     (1) A contract for NURSE Corps LRP participants serving as nurse faculty at an eligible school of nursing; and</p>
<p>     (2) A contract for NURSE Corps LRP participants serving as an RN or advanced practice RN, such as NPs, at a CSF.</p>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 2px;">Applicants should read this Guidance carefully and identify one contract service option of   interest and adhere to that option&rsquo;s specific instructions as they are integrated throughout this Guidance. Furthermore, applicants should be certain of their contract selection as they will not be able to apply to   serve as both NURSE Corps LRP nurse faculty and an RN in a CSF.  Applicants will not be able to  switch to the other service option at any time during their participation in the NURSE Corps LRP, whether  under the initial contract or under an optional continuation contract, should they receive an award.</td>

<h2>What are the benefits of NURSE Corps LRP?</h2>
<p>(1)<strong> Service.</strong> Participants will join thousands of RNs, NPs, and nurse faculty across the nation to meet the health care needs of underserved communities while ensuring a strong and sustainable nursing workforce for the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) <strong>Loan Repayment.</strong> NURSE Corps LRP will provide funds to participants to repay a portion of their outstanding qualifying educational loans. Participants receive the following benefits:</p>
<p>     a. <strong>60 Percent of Total Qualifying Nursing Educational Loan Balance.</strong> For an initial two- year service commitment, NURSE Corps LRP will pay participants a total of 60 percent (30 percent each year) of their total      outstanding qualifying educational loan balance incurred while pursuing an education in nursing, as of the effective date of the two- year contract.</p>
<p>     b. <strong>An Additional 25 Percent of Total Qualifying Nursing Educational Loan Balance.</strong> For a third, optional, year of service, subject to the availability of funds, NURSE Corps LRP will pay participants 25 percent      of their original total qualifying educational loan balance, as of the effective date of their initial two-year contract.</p>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 2px;">
<p>NURSE Corps LRP payments are subject to Federal taxes. NURSE Corps LRP will withhold Federal income tax and Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax (Social Security and Medicare) from a participant&rsquo;s award and pay those taxes directly to the IRS on the participant&rsquo;s behalf. All NURSE Corps LRP payments and Federal taxes withheld will be reported to the participant and the IRS on a Form W-2 after the end of the tax year. These loan repayments may also be subject to State and local income taxes. All loan repayments paid to the participant after Federal tax withholding must be used by the participant to repay qualifying educational loans. A participant&rsquo;s payments to his/her lenders or holders are subject to periodic verification by the NURSE Corps LRP.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&bull;<strong> Each year, participants will receive a W-2 Wage and Tax Statement form for the taxable income received during the tax year.</strong> Participants have two options for receipt of the W-2 form:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. NURSE Corps LRP will mail your W-2 to the address you provide in the Program Portal.</p>
<p>2. You may sign up to have the W-2 form posted in your Program Portal account.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you choose mailing, please ensure your address and contact information is up to date by November 30th of each year to avoid a delay. W-2s are generally mailed by January 30th of each year.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Under the Treasury Offset Program, the Treasury Department is authorized to offset NURSE Corps LRP payments for the application to delinquent Federal and State debts, including delinquent child support.</p>

<p>Individuals in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard, are eligible to participate in the NURSE Corps LRP.  Reservists should understand the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&bull; Military training or service performed by reservists will not satisfy the NURSE Corps LRP service  commitment. If a participant&rsquo;s military training and/or service, in combination with the participant&rsquo;s   other absences from the facility or school of nursing, will exceed 7 weeks (35 workdays) per service year  as set forth under Service Requirements (see page 18), the participant should request a suspension of   his/her service obligation.  The NURSE Corps LRP payments will be stopped while the reservist is on an  approved suspension and will resume when the reservist returns to full-time service.  The service  obligation end date will be extended to compensate for the break in service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&bull; If the approved facility or school of nursing where the reservist is serving at the time of his/her deployment is unable to reemploy that reservist, the reservist will be expected to complete his/her NURSE Corps LRP service obligation at another eligible, approved facility or school of nursing.  The reservist must contact the NURSE Corps LRP to request a transfer and receive approval, in accordance with the transfer policy (see page 21 of the APG).</p>

<h3>What kinds of loans are eligible?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="3983_8_1232_293">
<p>Qualifying loans are government and commercial loans for actual costs paid for reasonable educational and living expenses incurred (1) while attending a school of nursing where you obtained your qualifying nursing education, and (2) while taking only nursing prerequisite courses at schools other than the school(s) of nursing where you obtained your qualifying nursing education, provided that you received academic credit for those courses from the school of nursing where you obtained your qualifying nursing education.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some examples of loans that are eligible for the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&bull; Nursing Student Loans that are not subject to cancellation</p>
<p>&bull; Stafford Loans</p>
<p>&bull; Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For registered nurses and advanced practice registered nurses working in a Critical Shortage Facility, qualifying nursing loans must apply only to loans taken to obtain a diploma, associate&rsquo;s, bachelor&rsquo;s, master&rsquo;s, doctoral (or an equivalent) degree in nursing.  For registered nurses working as full-time nurse faculty, the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program will consider loans taken for relevant degrees in Education as qualifying.</p>

<h3>Are co-signed loans eligible for NHSC LRP?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="4341_8_1232_41">

<p></p>
<h3>Can loans be consolidated during the application process?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="4447_8_1232_146">
<p>Under certain circumstances, consolidated loans may be eligible for repayment through the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program. For example, if you submitted documentation verifying that each loan included in the consolidation was incurred for qualifying nursing education, the consolidation is eligible.  But, if any non-qualifying loan is included in the consolidation, the entire consolidated loan is ineligible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your loans are consolidated between the application deadline and prior to the date an award is made, those loans will not be considered for loan repayment. Therefore, if you are planning to consolidate your loans, you are encouraged to do so either before the application deadline or after receipt of an award.</p>

<h3>Why is a Parent plus Loan ineligible for repayment under the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="5043_8_1232_41">
<p>Parent PLUS Loans are ineligible for the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program because the parent, not the participant, is liable for repayment of the loan.</p>

<h3>My lender cannot provide me with the loan documents required for my NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program application by the application deadline. What should I do?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="5173_8_1232_125">
<p>Here are some tips for obtaining loan documents by the deadline:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&bull; First, when contacting your lenders, advise them of the urgency of receiving the paperwork by the deadline.</p>
<p>&bull; Second, see if your lender has a website where you can login and download your own loan information (many do, such as Sallie Mae).</p>
<p>&bull; Third, you can log into the <a href="https://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/">National Student Loan Data System</a>, which contains information on most Federal student loans.</p>







</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Does the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program conduct a credit check on applicants?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="5363_8_1232_62">
<p>Yes, the Nursing Education NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program obtains a credit report on each eligible applicant to assess eligibility, creditworthiness, and suitability to participate in the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program. The credit check is also used to verify educational loans.</p>







</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>If I have personal debt such as credit cards/bankruptcy or other personal defaulted debt, does this hurt my chances of receiving the award?</h3>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="5490_8_1232_62">
<p>Personal debt alone will not affect whether or not a person is awarded, for example mortgages, car loans, credit card debt are forms of personal debt that will not affect being selected for award.  Only if they have defaulted on their financial obligations, will that affect a person&rsquo;s ability to be selected for award.</p>

<h1>Awards</h1>
<h2>How does NURSE Corps LRP determine which nurses will receive loan repayment?</h2>
<p>Historically, the number of qualified applicants has exceeded available NURSE Corps LRP funding. Consequently, the program uses funding preferences to determine the sequential order in which qualified applicants are considered for an award. A funding preference will be given to applicants with the greatest financial need, defined as those qualified applicants whose debt to salary ratio (i.e.,  total qualifying educational loans divided by base annual salary) is 20 percent or greater. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Applicants will then be grouped into funding preference tiers as described in the tables below.

<h4>Disadvantaged Background</h4>
<p>An individual from a <strong>disadvantaged background</strong> is defined as someone who (1) comes from an environment that has inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to enroll in and graduate from a health professions or nursing school (Environmentally Disadvantaged) OR (2) comes from a family with an annual income below a level based on low-income thresholds according to family size published by the U.S. Census Bureau, adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for adaptation to this program (Economically Disadvantaged). Please refer to Definitions on page 34 for examples of environmentally or economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>(2) For registered nurses</h3>
<p>Including advanced practice registered nurses such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), qualified applicants will be grouped into one of the funding preference tiers based on factors described in the table below. An applicant&rsquo;s debt to salary ratio, the type of facility where the applicant is  working, and the facility&rsquo;s HPSA score are used to determine the tier in which the applicant is placed. Starting with the first tier, awards will be made in order of decreasing debt to salary ratio until funds are expended.</p>

<tr>
<td style="padding: 2px;">
<p>Amanda completed her nurse practitioner program in May 2010. Her current outstanding qualifying educational loan debt totals $26,683.57. Amanda works as an NP at a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) with a primary medical care HPSA score of 10, and her base annual salary is $51,001. <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Tom is also an NP and works at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with a </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">mental health HPSA score of 12. His base annual salary  is  $46,238.40  and  he has outstanding qualifying educational loan debt totaling $17,465.04.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since Amanda and Tom both work at a CSF with a HPSA score between 10 and 13 and their debt to salary ratio is greater than 20 percent, they will be placed in Tier 2. However, because Amanda has a debt to salary ratio of 52.32 percent, which is greater than Tom&rsquo;s debt to salary ratio of 37.77 percent, Amanda will be funded before Tom, if funds are still available. Although Tom&rsquo;s facility has a higher HPSA score, it does not place him at an advantage of being funded prior to Amanda because they fall within the same Tier. In another scenario, if the CSF Tom works at had a HPSA score of 15, Tom would be  funded before Amanda because the HPSA score places him in Tier 1.</p>

<h1>Contract Requirements</h1>
<h2>What should I expect if I am selected as a possible recipient of a NURSE Corps LRP award?</h2>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="13283.78125_8_1232_357">
<p>NURSE Corps LRP frequently corresponds with applicants by email or via the Program Portal. It is critical that applicants use and maintain a current email address. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Please check your email during the application process for correspondence from NURSE Corps LRP and make certain to disable SPAM blockers (or check the SPAM folder).</em></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>If the application is approved, NURSE Corps LRP will notify the applicant by email that he/she has been identified as a possible recipient of a NURSE Corps LRP award. The applicant will be required to verify continued full-time employment at the CSF or school of nursing identified in the online application. The applicant will then be required to complete the additional required forms (i.e., NURSE Corps LRP  contract and banking information to facilitate electronic transfer of award funds) via the Customer  Service Portal. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This notification does not guarantee an award.</strong></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are two separate NURSE Corps LRP contracts:</span> one for RNs (including advanced practice registered nurses such as NPs) serving at a CSF and one for RNs serving as nurse faculty at an eligible school of nursing. If an applicant is selected for a NURSE Corps LRP award, the individual&rsquo;s contract is countersigned by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his/her designee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that a contract becomes effective when it is countersigned/executed by the Secretary or his/her designee. The new awardee will receive an award notice via email, and then be able to download the award letter, a copy of the awardee&rsquo;s fully signed (executed) contract, a Payment Authorization Worksheet (PAW), and a welcome packet from the Program Portal. Once an applicant enters into a NURSE Corps LRP contract that provides for a particular type of service (service at a CSF or at a school of nursing), the applicant will not be allowed to switch to the other type of service during the initial 2-year service period or the third optional service year.</p>

<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="13711.78125_8_1232_400">
<p>Award payments are made monthly over 24 months through an electronic funds transfer to the participant&rsquo;s checking or savings account identified on the banking information submitted by the participant. The first direct deposit is made approximately <strong>60</strong> days after the effective date of the contract.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Individuals who are uncertain that they will be able to fulfill a two-year service commitment under NURSE Corps LRP are advised not to apply to this program. An awardee who fails to begin or complete his or her service obligation will be placed in default and subject to the monetary damages specified in  the NURSE Corps LRP contract. See pages 16 - 17 of the APG for more information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Important Requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>(1) Participants must use the NURSE Corps LRP payments to pay the lenders or holders of their qualifying educational loans, as indicated on a PAW that will be provided to participants with their award notice. Periodically, NURSE Corps LRP will contact a participant&rsquo;s lenders or holders to verify that award payments have been applied to NURSE Corps LRP-approved loans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) Participants must immediately notify NURSE Corps LRP, via the Program Portal, of any changes in name, mailing address, email address, or financial institution (bank) information to ensure an uninterrupted flow of loan repayment funds. Participants must also notify NURSE Corps LRP of any changes in service site and/or employment status. In the case of a name change, participants must also submit legal documentation, such as a copy of a marriage certificate.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>(3) If for any reason a participant does not receive a scheduled payment, the participant should contact NURSE Corps LRP as soon as possible through the Program Portal, via Customer Service 1-800- 221-9393, or email </span><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:GetHelp@hrsa.gov">GetHelp@hrsa.gov</a><span>.

<h1>Service Requirements</h1>
<h2>What are the service requirements?</h2>
<p>For nurse faculty who apply to serve at an eligible school of nursing: Nurse faculty must provide full- time service as a nurse faculty member at the eligible school of  nursing for a period of two consecutive years beginning on the effective date of the contract (see definition of School of Nursing).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Full-time service is working full-time (as defined by the employer) as a nurse faculty member for a minimum of 9 months per service year. No more than 7 weeks (35 workdays) of the participant&rsquo;s scheduled work period (9 to 12 months) per service year may be spent away from the accredited school of nursing for vacation, holidays, continuing education, illness, maternity/paternity/adoption, or any other reason. Periods of approved suspension will extend a participant&rsquo;s NURSE Corps LRP service obligation end date (see Suspension &amp; Waiver, page 23).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nurse faculty participants are encouraged to promote health care careers in underserved areas. This can be done via presentations to students, student organizations or other community based <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">organizations to provide information about nursing and/or other health care professions.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>For RNs, including advanced practice registered nurses such as NPs, who apply to serve at a CSF: RNs must provide full-time service, defined as working as an RN for at least 32 hours per week for two consecutive years beginning on the effective date of the contract. NPs must work as NPs and not as RNs. No more than 7 weeks (35 workdays) per service year may be spent away from the facility for vacation, holidays, continuing education, illness, maternity/paternity/adoption, or any other reason. Periods of approved suspension will extend a participant&rsquo;s NURSE Corps LRP service obligation end date (see  Suspension &amp; Waiver, page 23 of the APG).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For ALL NURSE Corps LRP participants</span>, the following rules apply:</p>
<p>(1) Participants must retain a current full, permanent, unencumbered, unrestricted license as an RN during the two-year service obligation to receive service credit under the NURSE Corps LRP;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) Participants must continue to work under the employer&rsquo;s verified scope of practice as an RN or nurse faculty member for the duration of the initial two-year service obligation to receive service credit under the NURSE Corps LRP;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) No service credit will be given for employment before the effective date of the NURSE Corps LRP contract. The effective date of a contract is the date the contract is countersigned by the Secretary or his/her designee;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(4) If an applicant fails to commence full-time service on the effective date of the contract at the CSF or eligible school of nursing identified in the application, he/she may be placed in default;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(5) All participants serving at a CSF must complete their service obligation in the capacity that corresponds with their current license to practice as an RN or advanced practice RN; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(6) Once an applicant enters into a NURSE Corps LRP contract that provides for a particular type of service (service at a CSF or at a school of nursing), the applicant will not be allowed to switch to the other type of service during the initial 2-year service period or the third optional service year.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is a Continuation Contract?</h3>
<p>NURSE Corps LRP participants may be eligible for a third year of loan repayment in exchange for an additional year of service as an RN at a CSF or as a nurse faculty member at an eligible school of nursing, subject to the availability of funds. The following conditions must be met to be eligible for a continuation contract:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) A participant must submit an application for a continuation contract through the Customer Service Portal no later than 30 days prior to the end of the second service year. When the continuation application is available, participants will be notified by NURSE Corps LRP.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) The service site&rsquo;s Point of Contact must complete the 18-month In Service Verification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) A participant must continue to serve full-time at the approved CSF or accredited school of nursing as set forth in his or her initial 2-year contract, and continue to serve there under the continuation contract. A pending transfer request may delay the review of the continuation contract application.</p>

<p>(4) A participant must have a current, full, permanent, unencumbered, unrestricted license as an RN and retain it during the one-year service obligation;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(5) NURSE Corps LRP payments received after Federal tax withholding under the NURSE Corps LRP two-year contract must have been applied to reduce the original qualifying educational loan balances, as indicated on the Payment Authorization Worksheet (PAW) that participants received with their award notice. A participant&rsquo;s loan balances will be verified and a payment history from his or her lender(s)/holder(s) will be required. Failure to apply all NURSE Corps LRP payments to reduce the original qualifying educational loan balance will result in the denial of a request for a continuation contract;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(6) A participant must not have an existing service obligation (including any under state-sponsored loan repayment/forgiveness programs; or under employer-sponsored scholarship or recruitment/retention incentive programs) other than NURSE Corps LRP (there is an exception for members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard);</p>
<p></p>
<p>(7) A participant must continue to meet all other program eligibility criteria, must be in full compliance with his or her existing NURSE Corps LRP service obligation, and must be planning to work for the duration of the continuation contract at the same approved CSF or accredited school of nursing; and,</p>
<p></p>
<p>(8) A participant must not have defaulted on any Federal payment obligations (e.g. Health Education Assistance Loans, Nursing Student Loans, FHA loans, Federal income tax liabilities, etc.) or non-Federal payment obligations (e.g. court ordered child support payments, mortgage payments, etc.).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under a continuation contract, participants will receive an amount equal to 25 percent of their original qualifying educational loan balance. Participants may not add new loans to  their continuation contract application. The continuation contract service period must begin immediately following the completion of the initial 2-year service commitment.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Will I earn a salary during my service obligation?</h3>
<p>NURSE Corps LRP participants will receive salary and benefits from the employing CSF, professional group, or accredited school of nursing. Employment compensation packages may be negotiated between the nurse and the employer. The facility, professional group, or school of nursing cannot guarantee a NURSE Corps LRP award. Therefore, NURSE Corps LRP loan repayments should not be a part of any salary negotiations between the nurse and the employer.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>May I be absent from my site and receive service credit?</h3>
<p>No more than 7 weeks (35 workdays) per service year may be spent away from the facility or accredited school of nursing for vacation, holidays, continuing education, illness, maternity/paternity/adoption, or any other reason. NURSE Corps LRP-approved absences totaling greater than 7 weeks (35 workdays) in a  service year require an extension of the contract end date.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>How does the NURSE Corps LRP verify my service?</h3>
<p>The NURSE Corps LRP verifies that participants are meeting program requirements and fulfilling their service obligation. The In Service Verification (ISV) is completed by both the participant and the approved CSF or school of nursing through the Program Portal. By completing and signing the verification, the participant and the site are certifying the participant&rsquo;s compliance or noncompliance with the full-time service requirements during the identified period. The verification will also record the time spent away from the service site (i.e., the total number of days during the period that the participant fell below the minimum full-time service requirement).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants who fail to complete and submit their ISV through the Program Portal, within 30 days of notification that the service verification is due, may jeopardize receiving service credit, have payments stopped, and be recommended for default. It may also impact eligibility for a continuation contract.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h3>What is the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program service commitment?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">All NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program participants must enter into a contract agreeing to work full-time (at least 32 hours per week) as a registered nurse or advanced practice registered nurse, such as a nurse practitioner, at an approved Critical Shortage Facility for two consecutive years or be employed as a full-time (as defined by the school) nurse faculty member at an accredited school of nursing. In exchange, the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program will pay 30 percent of your total qualifying educational loan balance for each service year (for a total of 60 percent). You must retain a valid license as a registered nurse during the two-year service commitment.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>When does the two-year service commitment begin?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">The effective date of your contract is the date your contract is countersigned by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his/her Designee. Your service credit will commence upon the effective date of your contract. Your signature alone on the contract does not constitute a contractual agreement.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>How many hours must I work at the Critical Shortage Facility or eligible school of nursing to be considered full-time and therefore eligible for NURSE Corps Loan Repayment?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">Full-time service requires registered nurses and advanced practice registered nurses to provide no fewer than 32 hours of nursing service per week (for a minimum of 45 weeks per service year) at a single Critical Shortage Facility. Full-time service for a nurse faculty member working at an accredited school of nursing is determined by the employing school of nursing for a minimum of nine months per year.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>If I receive a NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program award, how do I deal with extended time away from my service site during my service period for medical or other personal reasons?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">If you know you will have extended time away from your service site for medical or other personal reasons, please notify the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program in advance of your expected departure date from work and date you will return to work.  The time away from your service site will be combined with your other absences during the service year.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">If your cumulative time away from your service site will exceed 7 weeks (35 work days) per service year (12 weeks for maternity/paternity leave), your payments will be stopped, and you must notify the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program immediately through the Customer Service Portal. This will also result in your service obligation end date being extended accordingly.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>Travel time is allowed for my job.  Does this time count against the total hours worked on the 6 months verification?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>If I am working part-time, am I eligible for the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">Part-time work is not eligible for fulfillment of the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program.  You must work a minimum of 32 hours per week at a single Critical Shortage Facility. If you are a nurse faculty member, you must work full time as defined by your accredited school of nursing for a minimum of nine months per year.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>Can a person split their 40 hours between 2 sites?  Would they be considered full time?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">In the APG (page 8), to be eligible you must work 32 hours at a public or nonprofit CSF. Which means you can only work at one site.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h3>What role does my employer have during my participation in the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">Your employer must complete a simple employment verification form every Six months during your participation in the program to verify your service.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">It is important that you check to ensure your employer completes this verification because if your employer does not complete the employment verification form in its entirety as instructed, your NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program payments will be stopped. If the problem is not resolved, and we cannot verify your compliance with the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program&rsquo;s full-time service requirement, you will be placed in default of your NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program contract and will be liable to repay all NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program funds received plus interest.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<h3>Am I still eligible for the award if the status of my license changes during the two-year service commitment?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">To continue to be eligible for the award, you must have a current, full, permanent, unencumbered, unrestricted license as a registered nurse in the State in which you intend to practice or are authorized to practice in the state pursuant to the Nurse Licensure Compact (Please refer to the Nurse Licensure Compact State listing at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.ncsbn.org/158.htm" target="_blank">https://www.ncsbn.org/158.htm</a>) and retain the permanent unrestricted license as a registered nurse during the two-year service commitment.</p>

This date will be used as the start date for your maternity or paternity leave. When you return to work, you will need to submit:</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">&bull; A letter from a Personnel Official at your facility, stating the date that you returned to work and your work status (i.e., full time/ how many hours per week you work); and,</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">&bull; A completed copy of the Employment Verification Form (EVF). NOTE: the end date on the EVF needs to be entered as the day/date that you actually returned to work.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">&bull; When you complete your EVF, make sure that all of the maternity leave and any other time taken off is included on the form.</p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;"></p>
<p style="font-size: 13.63636302948px;">&bull; According to the Application and Program Guidance and your NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program contract, you are allowed a maximum of seven (7) weeks of leave per contract year &ndash; this covers any and all types of leave that you may use.  If you exceed the allotted amount of leave, your contract will be extended to include the extra time off that was taken. The way this relates to your maternity leave is that you are allowed to take up to 12 weeks of maternity leave, however, that would also include the maximum seven weeks of leave that is allowed. So if you choose to take the full 12 weeks (7 weeks + 5 additional weeks), your contract will be extended five weeks to cover the extra time taken off for maternity leave. If you needed to take more than 12 weeks of maternity leave (i.e., for medical reasons), you would need to submit a request for a medical suspension.</p>

<h2>What steps do I need to take if I want to transfer to a different CSF or accredited school of nursing prior to completing my service?</h2>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="19796.78125_8_1232_167">
<p><span>NURSE Corps LRP expects that a participant will fulfill his or her service obligation at the initial CSF or school of nursing; however, NURSE Corps LRP understands that circumstances may arise resulting in a participant&rsquo;s need to leave the initial facility or accredited school of nursing and complete service at another approved site. If a participant feels he or she can no longer continue working at the facility or accredited school of nursing, the participant should contact the NURSE Corps LRP immediately through the Program Portal, Customer Service (1-800-221-9393), or email (</span><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:GetHelp@hrsa.gov">GetHelp@hrsa.gov</a><span>).</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants who sign a contract to serve at an eligible site must transfer to an eligible site that falls in the same funding preference tier the participant was initially awarded in, or higher. If the participant leaves his/her service site without prior written approval of the NURSE Corps LRP, he/she may be placed in default.</p>






</pre>

<h2>How do I request a transfer to another facility or school of nursing?</h2>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="20043.78125_8_1232_670">
<p>If a participant needs to request a site change the NURSE Corps LRP must be notified through the Program Portal by selecting &ldquo;Activities,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Site Change Request.&rdquo; The request should include:</p>
<p>(a) the reason for the transfer and (b) a request to confirm eligibility and initiate employment verification for the proposed transfer site. A final employment verification request will be sent to the current site where the participant is serving after his/her last day of employment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that if the CSF or school of nursing is private for-profit, the transfer request will not be approved, as NURSE Corps LRP participants must fulfill their service commitment at a public or private nonprofit critical shortage facility or eligible school of nursing. (See page 11 for qualifying service sites.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants will receive an official decision from the NURSE Corps LRP via the Program Portal regarding the approval or denial of a transfer request. Leaving the approved service site without prior NURSE Corps LRP approval will result in immediate suspension of payments until the NURSE Corps LRP: (a) receives all required information from each CSF regarding the Site Change Request (i.e., completed Employment Verification from current site and prospective site) and (b) approves the participant&rsquo;s transfer request.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following are additional requirements for transfer requests:</p>
<p>(1) Participants who sign a contract to serve at a CSF must transfer to an eligible CSF that falls in the same funding preference tier the participant was initially awarded in, or higher. For example, if a participant was awarded in Tier 2, then the participant may only transfer to a site that meets the Tier 2 or Tier 1 requirements. Participants should contact NURSE Corps LRP to ensure that the CSF or school of nursing they are interested in transferring to is an approvable transfer site. Please note: Participants who transfer must remain in compliance with the service requirements under their original contract. For example, participants who receive a contract to serve at a CSF as an RN may not transfer to a school of nursing to serve as nurse faculty, or vice versa.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) Participants who sign a contract to serve as nurse faculty at an eligible school of nursing must transfer to another eligible school of nursing that falls in the same tier the participant was initially awarded in, or higher. For example, if a participant was awarded in Tier 1 at a school with 50% or more of the students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the participant must transfer to another school with 50% or more of the students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) NURSE Corps LRP payments will not be interrupted if there is a less than a 30-day break in service between the initial site and the approved transfer site. However, if the participant fails to resume service within 30 days of the stop-work date at the initial CSF or school of nursing, the NURSE Corps LRP will stop all loan repayments. Once the participant begins full- time service at another approved CSF or accredited school of nursing, the service end date will be extended accordingly and loan repayments will resume.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(4) If a participant ceases full-time employment at the initial site and does not resume service <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">at an eligible approved CSF or school of nursing within 60 days, the participant will be considered in breach of the contract and will be recommended for default.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>(5) An electronic Employment Verification will be delivered to the Point of Contact (POC) at the new site. The POC must fill out the verification completely via the Program Portal.</p>

<h2>What is a HPSA and how do I locate my facility&rsquo;s HPSA score?</h2>

<p>Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers and may be geographic, population, or institutional. NURSE Corps LRP will only be using primary medical care and mental health HPSA designations and scores. Facilities must have a HPSA designation by January 1, 2015 to be considered a Critical Shortage <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">Facility and an eligible service site for NURSE Corps LRP participants. The HPSA score as of January 1, 2015 will be the score used throughout the 2015 NURSE Corps LRP application cycle to determine funding preference tiers (see below). However, should a facility lose its HPSA designation any time prior to when awards are made, the facility will not be considered a CSF and the applicant will be ineligible for an award.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you will receive the full salary and benefits package that you have negotiated with your employer.</p>

<p>The contract for loan repayment is between you and the NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program.  Your employer may know that you are participating in the NURSE  Corps Loan Repayment Program; however, your employer will not be informed of the specific payments the NURSE  Corps  Loan Repayment Program is making to you.  Therefore, when compensation packages are negotiated between you and your employer, loan repayments should not be part of the salary negotiations.</p>

<h2>How do I receive my loan repayments?</h2>
<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="21722.78125_8_1232_62">
<p>Monthly payments are disbursed through an electronic funds transfer to your banking account as indicated on the Banking Information you submitted electronically. The first direct deposit is made approximately 30 days after the effective date of the contract.</p>

<pre class="jive_text_macro jive_macro_quote" jivemacro="quote" data-renderedposition="21834.78125_8_1232_62">
<p>Your payments usually are deposited into your bank account monthly, on or around the day of the end of your contract.  For example, if your contract ends on September 19, 2013, your payment should be deposited in your bank account around the 19th of each month.  However, payments can be delayed due to holidays, network difficulties, heavy workload volume, etc.</p>

<p>NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program payments are subject to Federal taxes. The NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program will withhold Federal income tax and Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax (Social Security and Medicare) from your NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program award and pay those taxes directly to the IRS on your behalf. All NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program payments and Federal taxes withheld will be reported to you and the IRS on a Form W‐2 after the end of the tax year. These loan repayments may also be subject to State and local incomes taxes. All loan repayments paid to you after Federal tax withholding must be used by you to repay qualifying educational loans. Your payments to your lenders or holders may be periodically verified.</p>

<p>The Secretary of Health and Human Services may, under certain circumstances, suspend (put &ldquo;on hold&rdquo;) or waive (excuse) the NURSE Corps LRP service or payment obligation. A request for a suspension or waiver must be submitted through the Customer Service Portal. Additional supporting documentation will be required following submission of the request.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>(1) Suspension.</h3>
<p>This mechanism provides temporary relief to a NURSE Corps LRP participant if he/she has short-term (not permanent) circumstances that currently make compliance with the obligation impossible or would involve an extreme hardship such that enforcement of the obligation would be unconscionable. Periods of approved suspension will extend a participant&rsquo;s NURSE Corps LRP service obligation end date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All periods of time away from the approved facility or school of nursing should be documented by the participant&rsquo;s service site on the ISV. If the total time away from the site, including the period of suspension, exceeds 7 weeks (35 workdays) per service year (see Service Requirements on page 18), the service obligation end date will be extended accordingly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The major categories of suspensions are set forth below:</p>
<h4>a. Medical or Personal Reasons</h4>
<p>A suspension may be granted for up to one year, if the participant provides independent medical documentation of a physical or mental health disability, or personal circumstances, including a terminal illness of an immediate family member (e.g., child or spouse, including a same-sex spouse regardless of where the couple lives), which results in the participant&rsquo;s temporary inability to perform the NURSE Corps LRP obligation. Upon receipt of the suspension request, the NURSE Corps LRP will notify the participant of instructions for submitting supporting documentation.</p>
<h4>b. Maternity/Paternity/Adoption Leave</h4>
<p>Participants must notify the NURSE Corps LRP of pending maternity/paternity/adoption leave and provide appropriate documentation. Maternity/paternity/adoption leave of 12 weeks or less will be automatically approved, if properly documented. If the participant&rsquo;s maternity/paternity/adoption leave will exceed 12 weeks during that service year, a suspension may be granted by the NURSE Corps LRP based on documented medical need.</p>
<h4>c. Call to Active Duty in the Armed Forces</h4>
<p>Participants who are also military reservists and are called to active duty will be granted a suspension, for up to one year, beginning on the activation date described in the reservist&rsquo;s call to active duty order. In addition to the written request for a suspension, a copy of the order to active duty must be submitted to NURSE Corps LRP. The suspension will be extended if the applicable Armed Forces entity continues the period of active duty. The period of active military duty will not be credited toward the NURSE Corps LRP service obligation.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>(2) Waiver.</h3>
<p>A waiver permanently relieves the participant of all or part of the NURSE Corps LRP obligation. A waiver will be granted only if the participant demonstrates that compliance with his/her obligation (a) is permanently impossible or (b) would involve an extreme hardship such that enforcement of the obligation would be unconscionable. A waiver request must be submitted by uploading a signed request letter, including the reason(s) the waiver is being sought, as an inquiry through the Program Portal. The participant will be contacted by the NURSE Corps LRP regarding the medical and financial documentation necessary to process the waiver request, and this documentation can be submitted through the Program Portal. Please note that waivers are not routinely granted and require a demonstration of compelling circumstances.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>When would my service obligation be cancelled?</h2>
<p>A participant&rsquo;s NURSE Corps LRP obligation will be cancelled in its entirety in the unfortunate event of death. No liability will be transferred to the participant&rsquo;s heirs.</p>

<p>Applicants should read the Guidance carefully and identify one contract service option of <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">interest and adhere to that option&rsquo;s specific instructions as they are integrated throughout this guidance. Furthermore, applicants should be certain of their contract selection as they will not be able to apply to serve as both NURSE Corps LRP nurse faculty and an RN in a CSF.  If awarded, the NURSE Corps LRP contract becomes effective on the date that it is countersigned by the Secretary or his/her designee.</span></p>
<p>An applicant may withdraw his/her application at any time prior to the Secretary signing the contract</p>
<p>and remain eligible to apply for NURSE Corps LRP in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Applicants will not be able to  switch to the other service option at any time during their participation in <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">the NURSE Corps LRP, whether  under the initial contract or under an optional continuation contract, should they receive an award.</span></p>

<h2>What should I do before I apply?</h2>
<p>Please read the Application and Program Guidance in its entirety before proceeding with an application. It explains the contractual obligations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and NURSE Corps LRP participants. Please understand that a NURSE Corps LRP contract is an obligation to serve full-time for 2 years at an eligible CSF or accredited school of nursing and that there are financial consequences for defaulting on the service obligation. Applicants are strongly encouraged to print and retain a copy of the Application and Program Guidance for future reference.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>When is the application deadline?</h2>
<p>A complete electronic application must be submitted by 7:30 pm EST on February 26, 2015. All supporting documentation described below must be uploaded to the Program Portal before a complete application can be submitted. The electronic Employment Verification (EV) (see below) must also be completed before an applicant can submit his or her application. Upon completion and submission of the online application, applicants will receive a printable receipt indicating a successful  submission.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What materials will I need when I apply?</h2>
<p>The information collected in the online application will provide an initial ranking of the application for purposes of the funding preference tiers. In the online application, the applicant will be required to select the physical site at which he/she is working and initiate an electronic Employment Verification (EV) that the Point of Contact (POC) at the site will complete.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that applicants do the following before attempting to complete the online application:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a) Review the Application and Program Guidance completely;</p>
<p></p>
<p>b) Develop a list of all institutions (diploma, associate, college, university) where loans were obtained for educational expenses incurred while pursuing the nursing degree, which will be submitted for loan repayment consideration. Applicants will be asked to provide the type of degree received, the school name and address, the attendance start and end dates, and the graduation date if applicable;</p>
<p></p>
<p>c) Develop a Curriculum Vitae (CV)/Resume, which documents all education, training, and degrees, and accounts for all time periods/employment since the applicant&rsquo;s completion of qualifying nursing education; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>d) Review the list of required supporting documents that must be submitted.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to upload all supporting documents in PDF format to expedite processing of the application. It is the applicant&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the information uploaded is accurate and viewable; PDF format allows applicants to view documents prior to submission. When uploading documents to the online application, please be sure that the documents do not exceed 5MB as the system restricts larger documents to maintain storage. Multi-paged documents can be uploaded; however documents with more than one page should be consolidated by scanning, saving into one document, and then uploading. If a document cannot be viewed or accessed, the NURSE Corps LRP will not consider it when reviewing and evaluating your application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the online application has been submitted, the application status will update accordingly. Applicants have the opportunity to make edits to their online application and resubmit their application by the application deadline (February 26, 2015, 7:30 pm EST). The &ldquo;edit&rdquo; option will be available in the applicant&rsquo;s account on the &ldquo;Submitted&rdquo; page. The ability to edit and resubmit an application will be disabled after the application deadline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Applications not resubmitted by the  deadline will not be considered for an award . No <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">exceptions will be made in cases where an applicant fails to resubmit an edited application.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<h2>Employment Verification</h2>
<p>Applicants will be required to select their employment site and initiate an electronic Employment Verification (EV) that the Point of Contact (POC) at the employment site will complete. Third party employment verifications will not be accepted. The EV must be completed by an appropriate official at the Critical Shortage Facility (CSF) or School of Nursing (e.g., the applicant&rsquo;s immediate supervisor or an authorized agent of the service site&rsquo;s human resources department). If the POC does not submit a completed EV, or the EV is not completed by the appropriate official, the application is considered incomplete and the applicant will not be able to submit the application.</p>

<h3>RNs Serving at a CSF</h3>
<p>Once an applicant &ldquo;initiates&rdquo; the EV process, a notification will be sent to the POC at the CSF selected in the application to complete the online verification. If the POC does not submit a completed EV, the NURSE Corps LRP application is considered incomplete and the applicant will not be able to submit the application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The applicant will be notified by email when the EV status is &ldquo;complete&rdquo; (i.e., when the POC submits the EV). The application can then be submitted. Upon submission, the applicant will be able to view the EV information provided by the POC. It is recommended that the EV be completed at least 3 days prior to the application submission deadline date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the information in the online application and the EV do not match, the applicant will be able to submit the NURSE Corps LRP application, however, the applicant will be considered ineligible. In such instances, the applicant may correct any mistakes in the information provided on the application or reinitiate the EV to the POC for correction prior to the February 26, 2015, 7:30pm  EST deadline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the applicant is unable to locate his/her CSF employment site in the NURSE Corps LRP database, he/she must notify the NURSE Corps LRP via the Program Portal to have the site reviewed and possibly added. The process to add a CSF Site can take up to 2 business days. Without the correct CSF site information in the NURSE Corps LRP database, the electronic EV cannot be initiated.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Important Notes:</h4>
<p>&bull; Completion of the electronic EV by the POC can take up to 5 business days or longer; therefore NURSE Corps LRP recommends that applicants initiate the EV process as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&bull; It is the applicant&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that a new site request and/or EV are submitted far enough in advance of the application deadline to allow sufficient time for processing.</p>
<p>&bull; Applications not submitted by the February 26, 2015 deadline will not be processed. The deadline will not be extended due to delayed receipt of the EV.</p>
<p>&bull; For Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs), Certified Nurse-Midwives (CNMs), and Nurse Practitioners (NPs) employed by a Professional Group that practices at a CSF, the facility must complete the EV, not the professional group.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Nurse Faculty Serving at a School of Nursing</h3>
<p>Once an applicant &ldquo;initiates&rdquo; the electronic EV process, a notification will be sent to the POC at the school of nursing selected in the application to complete the online verification. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the POC does not submit a completed EV, the NURSE Corps LRP application is considered incomplete  and the applicant will not be able to submit the application.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>If the applicant is unable to locate his/her accredited school of nursing in the NURSE Corps LRP database, he/she must notify the NURSE Corps LRP via the application to have the site reviewed and possibly added. The process to add a school of nursing can take up to 2 business days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without the correct school of nursing site information in the NURSE Corps LRP database, the electronic EV cannot  be initiated.</p>

<h4>Important Notes:</h4>
<p>&bull; Completion of the EV by the POC can take up to 5 business days or longer; therefore NURSE Corps LRP recommends that applicants initiate the electronic EV process as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&bull; Applications not submitted by the February 26, 2015 deadline will not be processed. The deadline will not be extended due to delayed receipt of the EV.</p>
<p>&bull; The NURSE Corps LRP is aware that not all schools of nursing require nurse faculty to maintain an RN license; however, the NURSE Corps LRP requires participants to maintain a current, full, permanent, unencumbered, unrestricted RN license while participating in the program. If your school of nursing does not require you to maintain an RN license, please be advised that you must do so to meet the NURSE Corps LRP eligibility requirements. It is the applicant&rsquo;s responsibility to make sure the <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5em;">POC has current licensure information to  complete the EV.</span></p>
<p>&bull; If the School of Nursing has a student enrollment from disadvantaged backgrounds of at least 50%, the POC must submit appropriate documentation to the Program Portal certifying that at least 50% of its students come from an environmentally or economically disadvantaged background (see Definitions on the APG).</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Transcripts</h1>
<p>Applicants must submit all transcript(s) from each college or university or school of nursing attended for all nursing education coursework directly related to the attainment of the nursing degree(s), if the applicant is seeking repayment for educational loans incurred while attending that institution. Disbursement dates of nursing loans must correspond with dates of nursing education received. For example, if you attended and graduated from an accredited school of nursing between the years of 2009 &ndash; 2014 your loan documentation must reflect a disbursement date within that time period. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The transcript must state the name of the institution, dates of attendance, and courses taken. If a degree was obtained, the transcript must include the type of degree and the date it was conferred or the applicant must provide another appropriate document with this information (e.g., a copy of a diploma). Unofficial or official transcripts are acceptable.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Change in Status during Application Process</h1>
<h2>What if I change jobs?</h2>
<p>Applicants may switch to a position at another eligible CSF or accredited school of nursing prior to 7:30 pm EST on February 26, 2015 and still be considered for a NURSE Corps LRP award. However, the employment information in the online application must match the information on the electronic Employment Verification. Therefore, if an applicant changes jobs and the online application is not updated and/or a completed electronic Employment Verification is not uploaded from the corresponding facility or school of nursing by 7:30 pm EST on February 26, 2015, the applicant will not be considered for an award.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>May I withdraw my application?</h2>
<p>As soon as the applicant becomes aware that he/she will not be able to commence full-time service at the facility or school of nursing identified in the application, the applicant should immediately submit a  request through the Customer Service Portal to withdraw the application.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The NURSE Corps LRP contract becomes effective on the date that it is countersigned by the Secretary or his/her designee. An applicant may withdraw his/her application at any time prior to the Secretary signing the contract and remain eligible to apply for NURSE Corps LRP in the future.</strong> Once the contract becomes effective, the applicant is obligated to provide two years of full-time service at the CSF or school of nursing identified in the application. If such applicant fails to commence service on the effective date of the contract, the applicant will be in breach of the contract and may be placed in default and become permanently disqualified from receiving future awards under the NURSE Corps LRP  and some other Federal programs.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What if I want to consolidate my educational loans?</h2>
<p>An applicant may consolidate/refinance loans before the application deadline provided that he/she submits loan documentation for the consolidated/refinanced loans before the application deadline of 7:30 pm EST on February 26, 2015. If the loan documentation is not received by the application deadline and the consolidated loan does not appear on the online application, the consolidated/refinanced loan(s) will not be considered for loan repayment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the applicant has consolidated otherwise qualifying educational loans with other ineligible debt or with the loans of another individual, the entire consolidated loan is ineligible. Loans that are consolidated or refinanced after the application deadline and prior to the date an award is made will not  be considered for loan repayment.</p>
